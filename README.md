# Electronics and Computer Enginnering Student 

## About Me 
I’m a third-year Electronic and Computer Engineering student at Politechnika Wroclawska, currently gearing up for my sixth semester. My passion lies in hardware design, yet my interests also extend deeply into artificial intelligence and computer vision. Throughout my studies, I’ve embraced every opportunity to learn by doing—whether it’s through collaborative projects or hands-on technical challenges.

In my academic journey so far, I’ve contributed to diverse projects that reflect my versatility and drive. I played a key role in developing a remote-controlled, tank-like robot, where I was responsible for hardware design and integration. I also tackled an AI and computer vision project focused on traffic light and sign recognition for autonomous vehicles, working closely with my partner to manage every aspect of the project. More recently, I contributed to an optoelectronics project involving a laser sensor-based chronometer, handling everything from documentation and tool gathering to code integration and testing.

These experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but also reinforced my love for teamwork and collaborative problem-solving. I’m ambitious, hard-working, and a quick learner—qualities that drive me to seek an internship where I can dive into real-world projects, contribute meaningfully, and continue evolving as a professional. With graduation set for February 2026, I’m excited to make the most of the final semesters and bring my practical expertise to innovative teams.
